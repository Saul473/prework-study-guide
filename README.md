# Prework Study Guide

## This prework study guide was made by me with the purpose of providing notes that I'll be able to look back on when I have questions. I have never played with the idea of coding, this introductory work had a lot of information that I probably will not memorize right away so what better thing to do than to make a study guide! This study guide may not be the most detailed study guide, but it covers what I feel are the key notes to know. It includes notes for: HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. This is only the beginning, I am hoping to expand notes as I go on from here!
